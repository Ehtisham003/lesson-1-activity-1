            <h2>Facts about cats</h2>
            <p>
                Cats have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of time. Unlike humans, cats don’t have the
                ability to
                create actual measures of time, like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t know how to read
                clocks. So, telling
                them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much, but we understand that you feel like you have to
                do it anyway!
                Cats are capable of being trained based on past events, and can be taught to anticipate future events
                based on past
                experiences. Pavlov’s cats are the perfect example of this.

                extinct Pleistocene
                cats, and the modern cats is the cats nearest living relative. Cats were the first species to be
                domesticated by
                people over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture.
