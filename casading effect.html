    <p>This is a standard paragraph. Its color is determined by the `p` selector in the internal CSS.</p>

    <p class="highlight">This paragraph has a class `highlight`. Its color is green, overriding the `p` selector.</p>

    <p style="color: red; font-style: italic;">This paragraph has inline styles. Its color is red, overriding both the
        `p` selector and the `.highlight` class.</p>

    <p id="special-text">This paragraph has an ID `special-text`. Its color is purple and it's underlined, as ID
        selectors have the highest specificity.</p>

    <p class="highlight" style="color: orange;">This paragraph has both a class and inline styles. The inline style for
        color (orange) takes precedence over the class style (green).</p>
