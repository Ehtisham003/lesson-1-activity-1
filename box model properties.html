    <p class="model"> Hi all</p>
    <p class="box"> Today I am going to take about fast food.Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale, with a strong priority placed on speed of
    service. Fast food is a commercial term, limited to food sold in a restaurant or store with frozen, preheated or
    precooked ingredients and served in packaging for take-out or takeaway. Fast food was created as a commercial strategy
    to accommodate large numbers of busy commuters, travelers and wage workers.</p>
